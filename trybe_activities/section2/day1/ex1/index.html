  <h3>Starman</h3>
  <p>Hey la-la<br>
    Oh, oh, oh<br>
    Didn't know what time it was<br>
    The lights were low, oh, oh<br>
    I leaned back on my radio, oh, oh<br>
    Some cat was layin' down some rock 'n' roll lotta <br>soul, he said<br>
    Then the loud sound did seem to fade<br>
    Came back like a slow voice on a wave of phase<br>
    That weren't no DJ<br>
    That was hazy cosmic trace<br>
    There's a Starman waiting in the sky<br>
    He'd like to come and meet us<br>
    But he thinks he'd blow our minds<br>
    There's a Starman waiting in the sky<br>
    He's told us not to blow it<br>
    'Cause he knows it's all worthwhile<br>
    He told me<br>
    Let the children lose it<br>
    Let the children use it<br>
    Let all the children boogie<br>
    I had to phone someone, so I picked on you<br>
    Hey, that's far out, so you heard him too!<br>
    Switch on the TV, we may pick him up on channel two<br>
    Look out your window, I can see his light<br>
    If we can sparkle, he may land tonight<br>
    Don't tell your poppa or he'll get us locked up in fright<br>
    There's a Starman waiting in the sky<br>

    But he thinks he'd blow our minds<br>

    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>
    La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la<br>

    <h3 id="hotel">Hotel Califórnia</h3>
    <p>On a dark desert highway<br>
      Cool wind in my hair<br>
      Warm smell of colitas<br>
      Rising up through the air<br>
      Up ahead in the distance<br>
      I saw a shimmering light<br>
      My head grew heavy and my sight grew dim<br>
      I had to stop for the night<br>
      There she stood in the doorway<br>
      I heard the mission bell<br>
      And I was thinking to myself<br>
      "This could be Heaven or this could be Hell"<br>
      Then she lit up a candle<br>
      And she showed me the way<br>
      There were voices down the corridor<br>
      I thought I heard them say<br>
      "Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
      Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br>
      Such a lovely face<br>
      Plenty of room at the Hotel California<br>
      Any time of year (any time of year)<br>
      You can find it here"<br>
      Her mind is Tiffany-twisted<br>
      She got the Mercedes Benz<br>
      She got a lot of pretty, pretty boys<br>
      She calls friends<br>
      How they dance in the courtyard<br>
      Sweet summer sweat<br>
      Some dance to remember<br>
      Some dance to forget<br>
      So I called up the Captain<br>
      Please bring me my wine<br>
      He said, "We haven't had that spirit here
      Since 1969"<br>
      And still those voices are calling from far away<br>
      Wake you up in the middle of the night<br>
      Just to hear them say<br>
      "Welcome to the Hotel California<br>
      Such a lovely place (such a lovely place)<br>
      Such a lovely face<br>
      They livin' it up at the Hotel California<br>
      What a nice surprise (what a nice surprise)<br>
      Bring your alibis"<br>
      Mirrors on the ceiling<br>
      The pink champagne on ice<br>
      And she said, "We are all just prisoners here<br>
      Of our own device"<br>
      And in the master's chambers<br>
      They gathered for the feast<br>
      They stab it with their steely knives<br>
      But they just can't kill the beast<br>
      Last thing I remember, I was<br>
      Running for the door<br>
      I had to find the passage back<br>
      To the place I was before<br>
      "Relax, " said the night man<br>
      "We are programmed to receive<br>
      You can check-out any time you like<br>
      But you can never leave!"</p><br>
